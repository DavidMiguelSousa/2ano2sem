# Project Jobs4U

## 1. Description of the Project

* Jobs4U is a company specialized in talent acquisition. The company provides recruitment services for job positions in its clients.
* The aim of this project is to develop, in an exploratory way, a solution that allows automating the main activities of the company. Therefore, a minimum viable product should be developed in 3 months.
* The companyâ€™s clients are other companies or entities that need to recruit human resources.
* In response to requests from its clients, Jobs4U develops all activities that allow it to select a set of candidates for job offers (from its clients). At the end of the process, Jobs4U must deliver to its client an ordered list of candidates for each job offer.
* The final recruitment decision is the responsibility of the client.
