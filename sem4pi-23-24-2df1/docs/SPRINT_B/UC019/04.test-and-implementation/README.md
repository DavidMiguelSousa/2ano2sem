# UC019 - As Customer Manager, I want to select the interview model to use for the interviews of a job opening (for their evaluation/grading).

# 4. Tests

* For this user case, it is not necessary to create additional tests, as it is already covered by the framework's tests.*

# 5. Integration and Demo 

* A new option on the Customer Manager menu options was added.
* Path: `Login Customer Manager` > `3. Settings`  > `8. Select Interview Model`.
