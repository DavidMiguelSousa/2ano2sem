# UC016 - As Customer Manager, I want to setup the phases of the process for a job opening.

# 4. Tests 

**

**Test 1:** Ensure that the job opening phases do not overlap.

```java
public class SetupJobOpeningPhasesTest{
    
    @Test
    public ensureJobOpeningPhasesDontOverlap(){
    }
    
}

```

**Test 2:** Ensure that the job opening phases are correctly set up.

```java
public class SetupJobOpeningPhasesTest{
    
    @Test
    public ensureJobOpeningPhasesAreCorrectlySetUp(){}
    
}

```

**Test 3:** Ensure that the job opening phases are correctly displayed.

```java

public class SetupJobOpeningPhasesTest{
    
    @Test
    public ensureJobOpeningPhasesAreCorrectlyDisplayed(){}
    
}

```
