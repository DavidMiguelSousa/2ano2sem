# Sprint B Retrospective

## Overview

This retrospective covers our experiences and lessons from Sprint B, where we focused on foundational aspects of our project such as setting up the development environment and implementing core features. The sprint wasn't successful in achieving its goals, because we encountered hard challenges.

## What Went Well

### Learning and Integration of New Tools
- The team successfully used ANTLR4 to generate the parser and lexer for the plugin, as well as integrated it into the system.

## Challenges

### Bad Communication
- The team faced challenges related to communication, which led to misunderstandings and delays in the completion of tasks.

### Technical Difficulties
- The team encountered technical difficulties in setting up the development environment, which impacted the progress of the sprint.

### Flaws in Domain Modeling
- The initial domain model had some flaws that were identified during the sprint. Continuous improvement and refinement are needed to align the model more closely with project requirements.

## Lessons Learned

### Early Exploration of Tools
- The importance of exploring and deciding on all potential tools at the beginning of the project was a key lesson, ensuring that all available resources are utilized effectively.

### Iterative Development
- The development of complex models such as those based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles should be iterative, allowing for continual refinement and improvement.

### Strong Time Management
- The importance of strong time management practices was highlighted, as it is crucial to ensure that tasks are completed within the sprint timeline.

### Work harder
- The team needs to work harder to achieve the goals of the sprint.

## Recommendations for Future Sprints

- **Improved Communication:** The team should focus on improving communication to avoid misunderstandings and delays in the completion of tasks.
- **Technical Training:** The team should undergo technical training to address the challenges faced in setting up the development environment.
- **Domain Modeling:** The team should focus on refining the domain model to align it more closely with project requirements.

## Conclusion

Sprint B wasn't successful in terms of meeting timelines and accomplishing the set goals. Moving forward, the team will focus on addressing the challenges faced and implementing the lessons learned to improve the project's progress in future sprints, on time.
