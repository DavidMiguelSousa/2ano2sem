# US G006

## 1. Context

As a Project Manager, I want the team to elaborate a Domain Model using DDD.

## 2. Requirements

**US G006** As Project Manager, I want the team to elaborate a Domain Model using DDD.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The domain model must contain entities, root entities, value objects and services.
- The domain model must be organized in aggregates.
- The domain model must be implemented using DDD principles and patterns.

## 3. Analysis

* Define the concepts of entities, root entities, value objects and services in the context of DDD.
* Determine the specific requirements for the domain model, such as the entities and relationships that need to be represented.

## 4. Design

The design of this User Story is described by the project's Domain Model.

[Domain Model](DOMAIN_MODEL/domain_model.jpg).

## 5. Implementation

In this section, the team should present some evidence that the implementation is according to the design.

- It follows the DDD principles and patterns.
- It contains entities, root entities, value objects and services.
- It is organized in aggregates.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

no integration/demonstration.

## 7. Observations

The domain model is a key artifact in the project, as it represents the core concepts and relationships of the system.
The tool 'Visual Paradigm' was used to create the domain model and in 'Paint' the aggregates were drawn.
