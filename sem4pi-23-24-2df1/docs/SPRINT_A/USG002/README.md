## 1. Context

As Project Manager, I want the team to use the defined project repository (i.e.,
GitHub) and set up a tool for project management.

## 2. Requirements

**US G002** As Project Manager, I want the team to use the defined project repository (i.e.,
GitHub) and set up a tool for project management.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Configure the GitHub repository to serve as the centralized location for project files, source code, documentation, and collaboration.
- Utilize GitHub's project management features for task tracking, issue management, and team communication.


## 3. Analysis

* Determine the specific requirements for the GitHub repository, such as access control, branching strategy, and integration with development workflows.
* Explore GitHub's project management capabilities and identify how they can be leveraged to streamline project management tasks.


## 4. Design

* Define the structure and organization of the GitHub repository, including branches for development, testing, and production environments.
* Plan how to use GitHub's issue tracking, project boards, and collaboration tools for efficient project management.


## 5. Implementation

This section will detail the implementation of the GitHub repository and project management setup. It will include steps for:

* Creating the GitHub repository with appropriate permissions, branching strategy, and README documentation.
* Utilizing GitHub Issues for task tracking, bug reporting, and feature requests.
* Setting up GitHub Project Boards to visualize project progress, prioritize tasks, and manage workflows.
* Integrating GitHub Discussions or Wikis for team communication and documentation.


## 6. Integration/Demonstration

* Demonstrate the functionality of the configured GitHub repository, showcasing features such as version control, code review, and collaboration.
* Showcase how GitHub Issues and Project Boards are used for task management, progress tracking, and team communication.
* Ensure that team members understand how to use GitHub effectively for project management tasks.


## 7. Observations
Using GitHub as the sole project repository and project management tool streamlines project organization, communication, and collaboration. 
It provides a centralized platform for team members to access project resources, track progress, and manage tasks effectively. By leveraging GitHub's features, the team can improve productivity, transparency, and overall project success.
