# Sprint A Review

## Overview

Sprint A focused on laying the foundational elements of our project, including setting up the project structure (partially provided by the EAPLI framework), tool integrations and creation of the Project's Domain Model.
This document summarizes the achievements and areas for improvement.

## Achievements

### Completed Items

- **US G001**: The technical constraints and concerns were fully understood and implemented as per project documentation.
- **US G003**: The project structure was successfully configured to support the envisioned architecture, accelerating future development.
- **US G004**: A continuous integration server using GitHub Actions/Workflows was set up, automating builds and tests effectively.
- **US G005**: Scripts necessary for building, executing, and deploying the project were created and integrated, enhancing the workflow.

### Partially Completed Items

- **US G002**: The project repository was set up on GitHub. However, the integration of GitHub Projects for better issue tracking and project management was discovered and implemented later than planned. This feature will be better used in future sprints.
- **US G006**: A comprehensive Domain Model using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles was developed. Some minor flaws were identified in the DDD approach that will be improved continuously throughout the project.

## Lessons Learned

- **Early Tool Exploration**: It is beneficial to explore and decide on all potential tools and features at the beginning of the project to ensure that all available resources are utilized from the start.
- **Iterative Improvement**: The development of complex models such as those based on DDD principles can benefit from iterative review and continuous improvement.

## Conclusion

Sprint A was largely successful in achieving its foundational goals with significant progress made on all key user stories. The minor issues with GitHub Projects and the initial Domain Model were valuable learning opportunities that will enhance our approach in future sprints.
